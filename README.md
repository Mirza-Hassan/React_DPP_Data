# Digital Product Passport Generation

Description: 

Develop a user-friendly web application with frontend and backend components to facilitate the manual creation of Digital Product Passports (DPPs) by Alice. Users can input details, including start and end times of hydrogen production, hydrogen volume in kg, and the client's name. The frontend sends this data to the backend via an API call, which creates a unique DPP. Each DPP is displayed on a dedicated URL for easy sharing with Bob, the client.
